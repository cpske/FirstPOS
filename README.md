### Guidelines for Team

1. Know the repo layout so you commit files to the correct directories.
2. Use your real name on commits.
3. Use the Java coding and commenting convention as in OOP.
4. Test your code locally before pushing any code to remote origin.
5. Check the remote repository before committing, to ensure your copy is up to date.


### Repository Layout
  docs/ - documentation. Some required docs like SRS, Vision, SAD are on Google Docs.
  src/ - source code. Everything contained in packages
  resource/ - resources, such as property bundles and images
  
  
### Development guidelines

1. Create a local repo (`git clone git://github.com/cpske/FirstPOS/firstpos.git`)
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Write your code **and unit tests**
4. Ensure all tests still pass 
5. Ensure that your new code has test coverage (check out report/coverage/index.html after running tests)
6. [Lint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/) your code (`grunt jshint`)
7. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
8. Push the branch to remote (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
9. Create new [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for others to review your code
